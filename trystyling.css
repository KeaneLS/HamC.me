/* in CSS, you can begin writing immediately once the file is linked
to an HTML file (no need for declarations at the top like <!DOCTYPE>)

Typical syntax:

component {
    properties: values;
}

if its a custom class, then:

.classname {
    properties: values;
}
    
if you want to refer to nested elements, just refer to them using
the SHORTEST PATH that reaches them

ex: 

body main h1 {
    color: red;
}

the body is not necessary since there is only one main, so just do:

main h1 {
    color: red;
}
    
*/

body {
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;  /* this makes flex items stack vertically */
    align-items: center;     /* this centers items horizontally */
    min-height: 100vh;      /* this makes the body take up the entire heigh of the screen*/
    margin: 0;              /* removes the default margin */
}

main, .guy, footer { /* you can refer to multiple classes at once */
    width: 80%;             /* this makes each section take up 80% of the body width */
    text-align: center;     /* this centers the text inside each section */
    margin: 20px 0;         /* add some vertical spacing between sections */
    font-family: 'Poppins', sans-serif; /* sets the font family for the text */
}

main {
    padding: 20px;
    background: linear-gradient(lightgray, gray);
    box-shadow: 0px 4px 8px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);
    border-radius: 8px;
}

main h1 {
    color: black;
    /* Animation initialization: 
        name, timing, speed curve, delay before starting, iteration count, forward/backward */
    animation: pulse 2s infinite;
}

/* Animation Configuration:

@keyframes animation name {
    n% {
        property: value;
    }
}
    where n is the percent of the iteration (ex: 0% is the very beginning)
*/

@keyframes pulse {
    0% {
        transform: scale(1);
    }
    50% {
        transform: scale(1.1);
    }
    100% {
        transform: scale(1);
    }
}
