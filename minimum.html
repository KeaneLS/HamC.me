            semantic elements don't change anything about the code,

            but they are more specific)-->

            <p>This is also a paragraph below the header dawg</p>

<!-- in terms of STRUCTURAL ELEMENTS (i.e. whats required for the
 code to actually run) they are simply the following:

 <!DOCTYPE html> <-- doctype
 <html lang="en"> <-- lang
    <head> <-- head with important data
        <meta charset="UTF-8">
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
        <title>Minimum Required HTML</title>
    </head>

    <body> <-- body of the webpage
    </body>

 </html>
